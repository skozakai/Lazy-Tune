    // PSOLA Algorithm implementation steps:
    //WRITE CODE BELOW

    // 1. Time-domain pitch detection:
    //    Analyze the incoming audio signal to determine the pitch periods.
    //    This could be done using auto-correlation or a zero-crossing method.
    //    For this example, we will use a zero-crossing method.
    //    The zero-crossing method is simple and works well for monophonic signals.

    // 2. Divide the audio into pitch periods:
    //    Split the audio into separate grains, each corresponding to a single pitch period.
    //    This step is crucial for the subsequent time-domain processing.
    //    For this example, we will use a fixed grain size of 256 samples.
    //    This means that the pitch period must be a multiple of 256 samples.
    //    The pitch period is determined by the zero-crossing method in step 1.

    // 3. Time stretching or compression:
    //    Depending on the desired effect, each grain can be stretched (for a lower pitch)
    //    or compressed (for a higher pitch) in time without altering its spectral characteristics.
    //    For this example, we will use a fixed grain size of 256 samples.
    //    This means that the pitch period must be a multiple of 256 samples.
    //    The pitch period is determined by the zero-crossing method in step 1.

    // 4. Overlap and add:
    //    The processed grains are then recombined by overlapping them at the correct intervals.
    //    This step ensures a smooth transition between grains, minimizing artifacts.
    //    For this example, we will use a fixed grain size of 256 samples.
    //    This means that the pitch period must be a multiple of 256 samples.
    //    The pitch period is determined by the zero-crossing method in step 1.


    // 5. Output the processed block:
    //    The modified audio block is then transmitted for playback or further processing.

    
    transmit(block, 0);
    release(block);
